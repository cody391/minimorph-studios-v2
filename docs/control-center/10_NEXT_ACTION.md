## Current Gate: Admin Review Packet + Admin-Side Elena Fix Loop

**Priority:** P1
**Status:** OPEN — next gate after P0 Elena Contract Checkout Failure Gate (B-Card P0 Reopen)

| B-Card P0 Reopen (Elena contract bypass) | ✅ Done — actual Elena path now enforces agreement |

### Lifecycle Realignment — what changed

The correct MiniMorph operating model is:
1. Customer/lead talks to Elena
2. Elena gathers truth → Blueprint created
3. System auto-checks Blueprint readiness (completenessScore ≥ 60 → auto-approve, auto-generate)
4. Builder builds the site
5. Build report created
6. Admin reviews BUILT site + Elena chat + Blueprint summary + build report
7. Admin approves or denies
8. If approved → customer reviews built site
9. If admin denies → site routes to revisions stage

**Corrections made:**
- Gate 1.5 changed: no longer blocks on "pending"/"needs_changes" — only hard-blocks on admin "blocked" status. Admin reviews the built site (step 6), not the Blueprint pre-generation.
- `saveQuestionnaire` now auto-approves Blueprint when completenessScore ≥ 60. Elena conversation completion = customer confirmation. If payment confirmed, generation fires immediately.
- `adminDenyPreview()` added: lifecycle step 7 deny path → routes project to "revisions" stage.
- B10 redefined: customer reviews the **built site** (not Blueprint). Portal "approve site" flow, not "approve Blueprint."

### B-Card P0 Reopen — what happened and what changed

The original B-Card Gate (643ca4e) blocked the legacy `createCheckout` path. But the real buyer went through **Elena** and still reached Stripe — the legacy path was not the actual bypass.

**Root cause:** The Elena-to-Stripe path (`createCheckoutAfterElena`) had an agreement check that used the existing `customerAgreements` system, but `resendPaymentLink` silently proceeded without `agreement_id` when the agreement lookup failed, and the site generator had no gate to block generation when no valid agreement existed.

**What was fixed:**
- `shared/contractValidation.ts` (NEW): `validateContractReadyForCheckout()` — single shared validation helper used by all website package checkout routes. Validates agreement existence, userId/projectId ownership, acceptedAt, and signerName (rejects all sentinel/placeholder names).
- `server/routers.ts` — `createCheckoutAfterElena`: replaced inline validation with `validateContractReadyForCheckout()`. `agreement_id` is now unconditional in both top-level metadata and subscription_data.metadata.
- `server/routers.ts` — `resendPaymentLink`: agreement lookup is now **fatal** — throws `BAD_REQUEST` if no project found, throws `BAD_REQUEST` if no agreement found, throws `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` if lookup errors. No longer silently proceeds without `agreement_id`. Both metadata blocks now unconditionally include `agreement_id`.
- `server/services/siteGenerator.ts` — Gate 2.5 (NEW): self-service projects are blocked from generation if no valid accepted agreement with a non-sentinel signerName exists. Payment alone is not enough.
- `server/db.ts` — `getCustomerCardPacket()`: `lifecycleStatus` is now a structured object exposing `contractReadyForCheckout`, `contractIssueBlockingCheckout`, `contractIssueBlockingGeneration`, `contractIssueBlockingLaunch`, `hasValidSignerAgreement`.

---

## Required Next Action

**Admin Review Packet + Admin-Side Elena Fix Loop** — Ensure admin has full visibility into every customer's contract/agreement status before and after generation. Admin must be able to see whether a customer's accepted agreement is valid, whether generation was blocked, and whether manual contract review is needed.

After Admin Review Packet is complete, proceed to Internal Dogfood.

---

## Remaining Known Blockers Before MiniMorph Dogfood

- None from B6–B11 or B-Card P0. Dogfood is next after Admin Review Packet.

## Ecommerce Status — Intentionally Excluded

- **B2**: `server/templates/ecommerce/product.html:741` — `return false` in form handler.
- **Ecommerce is NOT part of the current launch path.** It is intentionally excluded.
- Elena does not offer ecommerce. Checkout does not accept ecommerce packages. Generator does not build ecommerce. B2 is not a launch blocker.
- Ecommerce is a future optional gate only if Cody reopens it.
