## Current Gate: Admin Blueprint Gate (B7)

**Priority:** P0
**Status:** OPEN — next gate after B6 Blueprint Schema Gate

### Why this gate is open

The Blueprint schema now has all 9 sections but admin has no hard gate to review the Blueprint before generation fires. Admin can currently bypass the customer Blueprint approval. There is no admin-reviewed checkpoint that verifies risk flags, regulated industry status, or claim safety before generation begins.

---

## Required Next Action

**Admin Blueprint Gate (B7)** — Add a hard `adminBlueprintApprovedAt` gate. Generation must be blocked until admin explicitly approves the Blueprint. Admin must be able to view all 9 Blueprint sections (including riskCompliance, positioning claims, addOnUpsellFit), flag risk items, edit Blueprint fields, and send back to customer/Elena if needed. The existing `adminApproveBlueprint` procedure must enforce this hard gate.

After B7 is closed, proceed to B8 (Claims/Proof Validation), then B9, B10, B11 in order.

## Remaining Known Blockers Before MiniMorph Dogfood

- B6: Blueprint Schema Gap — blueprintJson missing 6+ of 9 required sections
- B7: Admin Blueprint Gate Missing — no hard gate before generation
- B8: Claim/Proof Validation Missing — claims flow into generator without verification
- B9: Add-On Truth/Fulfillment Gap — Elena may recommend unimplemented add-ons
- B10: Customer Blueprint Approval Gap — customer cannot review/correct Blueprint before generation
- B11: Blueprint → Generator Instruction Gap — SiteBrief does not carry full Blueprint to generator

## Remaining Known Blockers Before Ecommerce Customers

- B2: `server/templates/ecommerce/product.html:741` — `return false` in form handler. Must be fixed before any ecommerce customer is onboarded.
